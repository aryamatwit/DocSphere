## Usage Instructions

### Starting the Server
1. Navigate to the directory containing `server.py`.
2. Run the server script:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
3. The server will start listening for incoming client connections on `localhost` (default port: `9999`).  
   You can modify the port in the code if needed.

### Connecting Clients
1. Navigate to the directory containing `client.py`.
2. Run the client script:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```
3. Enter a unique username when prompted.
4. The client will connect to the server and display:
   - A text editor for collaboration.
   - A chat panel on the right.
   - A user list at the top showing active users.

5. To start collaborating:
   - Begin typing in the text editor.
   - Use the chat panel to communicate.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. **Server Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure the server is running and accessible via the provided IP and port.
   - Verify network settings (clients and server must be on the same network or connected via public IP).

2. **Username Already Taken**:
   - Choose a unique username when connecting to the server.

3. **GUI Freezing**:
   - Avoid closing the server while clients are connected.
   - Restart the client if it becomes unresponsive.

4. **Document Not Updating**:
   - Check the server logs for errors.
   - Ensure the client has a stable network connection.

5. **Chat Messages Not Displaying**:
   - Verify that the server is properly broadcasting messages.
   - Check for disconnections in the server logs.
